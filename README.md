# Stock Market Prediction using Machine Learning

Predicting stock prices using machine learning models. This project explores various algorithms, including XGBoost, to analyze historical stock market data and forecast future price movements.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementations of machine learning models for stock price prediction.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared historical stock data for effective model training.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Utilization of industry-standard metrics, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2), to assess model performance.
- **Visualization:** Interactive visualizations for better understanding of stock price trends and model predictions.

## Project Structure

- `data`: Historical stock market data used for training and testing.
- `notebooks`: [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sYKRl8IIRc8vDQO-szH1Wghe4sa4D0YD?authuser=0#scrollTo=oCDswUcFIj6l](#) detailing the step-by-step process of data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `src`: Python scripts for project-specific functions and utilities.
- `models`: Saved machine learning models for reuse and deployment.

## Model Performance

- **R-squared (R2) Value:** 0.99899
